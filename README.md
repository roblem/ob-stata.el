# ob-stata.el
Modified version of `ob-stata.el` from the [the mirror of the EMACS repository](https://github.com/Fuco1/org-mode/blob/master/contrib/lisp/ob-stata.el) 
to strip commands in org-mode src output.

The description of what this does and how to use it is [found here](http://rlhick.people.wm.edu/posts/stata-and-literate-programming-in-emacs-org-mode.html).
